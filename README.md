# Puredit

> Purism, referring to the arts, was a movement (...) where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purism))

The **Pur**ist **edit**or is a projectional editor that uses textual code as its source of truth. Unlike other projectional editors, Puredit is based on the assumption that parsers are fast enough to continuously react to changes to a document and update the projections accordingly. Projections are derived from patterns on the abstract syntax tree. To make the definition of patterns easy, they are parsed from actual code snippets in the target language.
